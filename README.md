# ethernode
The goal of this Node.js module is to provide an interface for writing Solidity smart contracts from within Node.js and deploying them to an Ethereum client. In the final version of this module, users should be able to write functional smart contracts without complete knowledge of Solidity data types and functions (Node.js types and functions will be translated into Solidity to as much of an extent as possible). Users will also be able to discover many errors ahead of time, without having to wait until the contract is deployed.
